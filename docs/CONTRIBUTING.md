### 🌿 Branching & Workflow

We follow the **GitHub Flow**:

1. **Create a branch** for your work:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```  
2. **Commit changes** in logical chunks:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(run): support custom commands in existing containers"
   ```  
   - Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages.  
3. **Push** your branch to GitHub:  
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```

### 🔍 Coding Standards

- **Style Guide**: Follow [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html):  
  - `#!/usr/bin/env bash` at top of all scripts not sourced by dockero.sh.  
  - Indent with **2 spaces**, not tabs.  
  - Quote variables: `"$var"`.  
  - Limit line length to 80 characters where possible.
  - Prefer to use func4bash functions.
